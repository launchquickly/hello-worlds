# hello-world-rust
Rust hello-world example.

## Points to note
- [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) has been used as the build tool. A [Makefile](/rust/Makefile) has also been 
  added that wraps some of the cargo commands.
- the [.gitignore](/rust/.gitignore) file ignores the `target` directory created by cargo.
- [Cargo.toml](/rust/Cargo.toml) is used to manage the configuration of the project, including dependencies.
  configuration
- `fn main()` in file  [main.rs](/rust/src/main.rs) is the entry point for the Rust program.
- Rust source is located under directory `src` and tests are annotated with the `test` attribute.
